### >>Overview
The Master in Data Science is a highly-selective programme for students who want to begin or advance their careers in Data Science.
The duration of the programme is 1,5-years (90 ECTS), while the language of instruction is English. The programme offers 3 tracks (Computer Science Track / Statistics Track / Business Analytics Track). The first two semesters will be dedicated to core courses; students will select a track at the end of the second semester. Part of the programme is the Capstone project in Data Science, where students tackle specific and practical problems of an interdisciplinary nature. In this course students engage in all aspects of the lifecycle of data-science projects – from process modelling, data extraction, cleaning and validation, to data interpretation and visualization. The capstone project will begin in the summer term, after the end of the second semester.

### >>Course Descriptions
#### Core Courses
#### DSC 510: Introduction to Data Science and Analytics
This course will examine how data analysis technologies can be used to improve decision-making. The aim is to study the fundamental principles and techniques of data science, and we will examine real- world examples and cases to place data science techniques in context, to develop data-analytic thinking, and to illustrate that proper application is as much an art as it is a science. In addition, this course will work hands-on with the Python programming language and its associated data analysis libraries.
#### DSC 530: Probability and Statistics for Data Science
This is a theoretical course covering fundamentals topics of probability and statistics in the context of data science with its inherent challenges. This course will start with a review of fundamental probability, covering topics like random variables, their distribution functions, expected values, conditioning on certain events and independence. The students will be acquainted with certain families of probability distributions and then will learn how to estimate certain quantities of interest from observations. A range of properties of estimators will be studied, including sufficiency, unbiasedness and consistency, which enable the evaluation of their quality with an emphasis in the framework of big datasets. The students will also learn how to introduce different types of hypotheses, how to construct tests for their hypotheses, as well as how to compare between tests and how to construct confidence intervals for their estimators.
#### DSC 531: Statistical Simulations and Data Analysis
The students will be introduced to the R programming language, a programming language that was specifically developed for analyzing data, and is today widely used in most organizations that conduct data analysis. The students will learn how to explore datasets in R, using basic visualization tools and summary statistics, how to run different kinds of regressions and analyses, and how to perform statistical inference in practice, for example how to test certain hypotheses regarding the data or how to compute confidence intervals for quantities of interest. The students will also learn how to use R in order to conduct simulations, an extremely useful tool that can fulfill a wide range of analytical tasks. Simulation techniques covered will include Monte Carlo, importance sampling and rejection sampling. Finally, the students will learn how to estimate the precision of computed sample statistics using resampling methods. The course uses a hands-on approach, with nearly half the work done in the lab.
#### DSC 511: Big Data Analytics
This course seeks a balance between foundational but relatively basic material in algorithms, statistics, graph theory and related fields, with real-world applications inspired by the current practice of internet and cloud services. Specifically, this course will look at social and information networks, recommender systems, clustering and community detection, search/retrieval/topic models, dimensionality reduction, stream computing, and online ad auctions. Together, these provide a good coverage of the main uses for data mining and analytics applications in social networking, e-commerce, social media, etc. The course is a combination of theoretical materials and weekly laboratory sessions, where several large-scale datasets from the real world will be explored. For this, students will work with a dedicated infrastructure based on Hadoop and Apache Spark.
#### DSC 550: Business Analytics Applications
This course presents knowledge and skills for applying business analytics to managerial decision-making in modern organizations. Key topics include descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics, measuring the economic value of information in analytics investments, and using data to improve decision making under risk and uncertainty. Specifically, students will learn how to use data and analysis to make better decisions across different functional areas of the organization.
#### DSC 532: Statistical Learning
Students will acquire the knowledge to conduct statistical analysis on a variety of data sets using a wide range of modern computerized methods. The students will learn how to recognize which tools are needed to analyze different types of datasets, how to apply these tools in each case, and how to employ diagnostics to assess the quality of their results. They will learn about statistical models, their complexity and their relative benefits depending on the available data. Some of the tools that will be discuussed include linear simple and multiple regression, nearest neighbors methods, shrinkage methods (ridge, lasso), dimension reduction methods (principal components), logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, tree-based methods, model selection algorithms and clustering. The focus of the course will be less on theory and more on providing the students with as much intuition as possible and acquainting them with as many methods as possible. The course will make substantial use of the R statistical programming language and its libraries.

#### DSC552: Complex Thinking and Reflective Judgment in Business Analytics
The purpose of this course is to introduce Business Analytics students to complex forms of thinking, which, ultimately, lead to reflective judgment, in the effort to cope effectively with real-world problems, especially ill-structured ones. The course will explore the features of complex thinking, provide the tools for developing it, and suggest ways in which complex thinking leads to reflective judgment. 
Thinking becomes complex when it embraces uncertainty, accommodates paradox and allows for the ineffable; is dynamic and flexible; holistic, critical, and reflexive. Judgment becomes reflective when it is evidence-based and context-sensitive, while seeking unifying principles in the service of a good purpose. In this course, reflective judgment will be taken to be tantamount to practical wisdom (Aristotle’s phronesis). Developing reflective judgment, one needs to cope with paradoxes; reduce noise; grow a holistic and dynamic understanding of problems; get a proper grasp of intuition and insight, heuristics and biases; be in tune with one’s emotions; and sharpen critical thinking skills in ways that enable the disclosive framing of problems, namely, bringing to surface unspoken assumptions, hidden values, and the ethical dimension. Against a background of big data and AI, the course will explore the critical role of embodied knowledge, perception, and ethical clarity for reflective judgment.

Prescriptive analytics is the branch of data science that examines methods and tools for direct support in quantitative decision-making problems. It builds on insights from descriptive and exploratory analysis, and utilizes forecasts from predictive analysis to build integrative models that generate actionable recommendations to achieve desired goals. Thus, its emphasis is on identifying, among the set of feasible solutions (those conforming to functional requirements and constraints) those that optimize specific decision objectives. It is widely used in many application domains such as production, supply chain management, finance, healthcare, etc., to enhance decision-making effectiveness and improve operational efficiency. This course provides comprehensive exploration of different forms of optimization models and associated solution techniques, emphasizing their applications in practical cases.
