This is an initial working code that extracts the first 10 links from the links.csv file 
and allow the user to ask questions for those links. 

To run this code you need to: 
1) install the right libraries (see import statements) 
2) add your hf token (give permissions for hf inference) 
3) go to the gemma model on hf and accept to use the gated model 
4) run the code :
    4.1 when running the code locally the links are extracted to markdown, but when running on colab i get blocked as robot. 
       For this reason i provided you with the markdown and the extra files that when added to the same directory 
       will prevent the code from re-extracting the markdown and go straight to quesiton-answering
    4.2 (a good question is what are the master requirements)


Improvements ideas : 
1) the code can easily scale to all the links, 
2) add pdfs
3) remove redundancies 
4) add functions like history more models, more agent logic better data representation etc
5) try different models


please check the code and give me some feedback
