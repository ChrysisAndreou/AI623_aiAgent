hi  i added some code to github that kind of works, 
it extract the data from the links and you can ask questions, 
of course is just an initial code, 
i will iterate and improve it see my comments on github  on how to run it and my future plans. 
 
please check the code and give me some feedback 
 
 
to run this code you need to 
1) install the write libraries (see import statements) 
2) add your hf token (give permissions for hf inference) 
3) go to the gemma model and accept to use the gated model 
4) run the code to ask questions to the 10 ten first links in the link.csv file, 
a good question is what are the master requirements this code can easily scale to all the links, 
and will add pdfs when i find time. this is just an initial working code, 
there are some redundancies to be removed and some more functions to add, 
like history more models, more agent logic better data representation etc
